 - [Supervised Learning](https://github.com/vinay-git2412/Machine-Learning-Models/tree/main/Supervised%20Learning)Supervised learning is a machine learning method in which models are trained using labeled data. In supervised learning, models need to find the mapping function to map the input variable (X) with the output variable (Y).  
Supervised learning needs supervision to train the model, which is similar to as a student learns things in the presence of a teacher. Supervised learning can be used for two   types of problems: Classification and Regression.
 - [Un Supervised Learning](https://github.com/vinay-git2412/Machine-Learning-Models/tree/main/Un%20Supervised%20Learning)Unsupervised learning is another machine learning method in which patterns inferred from the unlabeled input data. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the structure and patterns from the input data. Unsupervised learning does not need any supervision. Instead, it finds patterns from the data by its own.
Unsupervised learning can be used for two types of problems: Clustering and Association.
