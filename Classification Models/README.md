# Classification Models

- [KNN Classification](https://github.com/vinay-git2412/Machine-Learning-Models/tree/main/Classification%20Models/KNN%20Classificaton)K Nearest Neighbor algorithm falls under the Supervised Learning category and is used for classification (most commonly) and regression. It is a versatile algorithm also used for imputing missing values and resampling datasets.
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/vinay-git2412/Machine-Learning-Models/tree/main/Classification%20Models/Logistic%20Regression)Logistic regression is a simple and more efficient method for binary and linear classification problems. It is a classification model, which is very easy to realize and achieves very good performance with linearly separable classes. It is an extensively employed algorithm for classification in industry.
